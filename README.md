# Simple-3D-Scoreboard-for-OBS
A simple HTML file to use as a OBS Source to keep track of wins/losses.

CSS and JS are all in one file to make it easier for laymen to use. The Size is very big on purpose for the same reason, so you don't have to change anything to scale it up.

# How to use
Add a Browser Source to OBS. There, you select local file and select the file. Set the width to 1100 and the heigth to 900. Resize and cut the bottom part with the settings. To change the values, right click and select "interact".
If you want to change the color, edit the file and go to the lines 96, 97 and 98.
